## Description

Phase 5 integration tests (end-to-end offline→reconnect→resolve). Existing `OfflineSyncResolverTests` with real `DataStore` already function as semi-integration tests.

**Severity:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** DefaultSyncService requires 19 dependencies; defer until integration test infrastructure exists.

**Related Documents:** AP-77 (Deferred)

**Status:** Deferred — future enhancement.
