## Description

No user-visible indicator for pending offline changes (badge, toast, banner).

**Severity:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Dependencies:** Would require adding `HasPendingCipherChangeDataStore` to `Services` typealias (currently not exposed to UI layer).

**Related Documents:** AP-U3, AP-00, OfflineSyncCodeReview.md, Review2/00_Main

**Status:** Deferred — future enhancement.
